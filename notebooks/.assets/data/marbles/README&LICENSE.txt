The Marbles Data Set - Point 8 GmbH 2017

The marbles data describes nine different types of marbles. For each type, 100.000 data points (i.e. 900.000 in total) were collected. Each data point is a RGB (red, green, blue) tuple collected from the respective marble while being rotated. An EV3 Light Sensor (LEGO® Mindstorms Education EV3) was used as the color sensor. The data set was collected as part of developing a live demonstrator at the beginning of 2017.
