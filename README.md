## Have a look

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/point8/data-science-learning-paths/HEAD)

_(Not everything is working using Binder, e.g. there is no Spark integration. We are working on it, but you should still get a good overview.)_


## Credits & Contributions

Course material developed by the team [@point8](https://github.com/point8) and [@clstaudt](https://github.com/clstaudt).

## Development

We use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to setup the python development environment.

After installing those two, run the following lines to be ready to develop:

```
pyenv install -s "$(cat .python-version)"
poetry env use "$(cat .python-version)"
poetry install
```

Now you can start your `jupyter-lab` UI with

```
poetry run jupyter-lab
```

or a classic `notebook` view with

```
poetry run jupyter notebook
```

### Working with on Apple Silicon M1 hardware

As there might occur some problems using the preferred setup on M1 hardware, you could also use [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

As the leading system is poetry, please update the requirements file according to the dependencies in the `pyproject.toml`.
